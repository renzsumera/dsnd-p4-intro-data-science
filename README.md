## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was inspired by a not-so-recent article in [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-so-many-data-scientists-are-leaving-their-jobs-a1f0329d7ea4) by a data scientist explaining why so many data scientists are leaving their jobs.

For this project, Stack Overflow data from 2017 was used to better understand:

1. How does salary and career/job satisfaction differ from developers who are actively looking and not actively looking for a new job?
2. What are the most important factors in assessing potential jobs to apply to?
3. Which factors would predict if developers will look for new jobs?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

The two CSV files are directly sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) containing the main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer. It also includes a schema listing all the questions used in the survey.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@lawrence.sumera/why-so-many-developers-are-leaving-their-jobs-d2ecd9557a88).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data and Udacity for guiding the creation of this repository and the blog post.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available above.
